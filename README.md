# ELSE-Templates
Language Template files for use in conjunction with ELSE mode

These templates are provided as is and could definitely be improved!

The templates for Ada, Java and C++ have seen almost no use in a real life programming environment and will need some extensive customisation before they can be considered 'useful' - but should serve as a useful starting point none the less.

The other templates have received use ranging from rudimentary to 'extensive' and can therefore be reasonably assumed to be useful.
